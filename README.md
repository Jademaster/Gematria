# Gematria

The file gematria.py when run will do a reverse gematria lookup...that is it will compute the mispar hapanim gematria of your hebrew word and then find all the words in modern hebrew which have the same gematria value. I hope this is useful and let me know if you have any ideas to improve or contribute :)
